# Pipeline progress — MacSessionGuard lock-detection fix

- [x] 0. Worktree isolation — done 10:26 — branch fix/mac-session-guard-lock-detection @ d4cf6dd
- [x] 1. blindspot --deep — done 10:44 — reports/blindspot-scout-{consumer-map,docs-constraints}-260720-*.md
- [x] 2. brainstorm --html + Artifact publish — done 11:02 — judge picked B (console-gated); reports/brainstorm-*; artifact brainstorm-design-artifact-260720.html published https://claude.ai/code/artifact/518d7d17-8a2c-4af2-9a2e-d8db9a3a3559 + opened locally; --auto auto-pick logged (decision #4)
- [x] 3. predict (report saved) — done 10:44 — reports/predict-260720-mac-session-guard-lock-detection.md (GO conditional on P1/P5/P7/P8)
- [x] 4. plan --tdd — done 10:44 — plan.md (115 lines, 11-case test table)
- [x] 5. red-team + validate — done 10:53 — round 1 BLOCKED (4 findings) → plan revised (R1–R5) → round 2 both PASS; reports/red-team-plan-review-round1-*, plan-validation-round1-*; version labels normalized to macOS 14–15
- [x] 6. codex adversarial-review <plan> — hop2 timed out (exit 124, background task b39wtphs8; see reports/codex-adversarial-plan-review-260720-report.md, no verdict) — auto-decisions #7 falls back to hop3 (Claude opus), folded into stage 11's diff review since code now exists (auto-decisions #8)
- [x] 7. impl-notes init — done 11:14 — impl-notes.md
- [x] 8. cook (TDD) — done 11:14 — reordered ahead of 6/7 to capture the locked-screen window (auto-decisions #8); MacSessionGuard.swift + tests + README fixed; live probe while genuinely locked reported isLocked=true isUnknown=false (impl-notes.md); full suite 192 tests green, 1 skipped
- [x] 9. impl-notes review — done 11:18 — folded into ship-gate reconciliation (impl-notes.md is short enough, no separate digest needed)
- [x] 10. code-review ∥ security-scan — done 11:22/11:18 — reports/code-review-260720-mac-session-guard-diff-report.md (DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, process-only), reports/security-scan-260720-mac-session-guard-diff-report.md (DONE, clean)
- [x] 11. codex adversarial-review <diff> (hop3 Claude opus fallback, folds in stage 6) — done 11:26 — reports/codex-adversarial-diff-review-260720-report.md — Verdict: PASS
- [x] 12. ship-gate --hard — done 11:30 — reports/ship-gate-260720-mac-session-guard-verdict.md — Verdict: PASS, merge-ready pending human-only FUS-via-SSH check (PR checklist)
- [x] 13. ship: commit(6c40919,84d7e83) → push → draft PR #5 (https://github.com/vietairs/open-codex-computer-use/pull/5) — done 11:34 — pre-merge review consolidated (auto-decisions #10, no CI configured, no new commits since diff review) → merge-ready comment posted; STOPPED here, no merge
- [x] 14. FUS-via-SSH gate — automation-verified as far as possible: same-user branch confirmed (416 live samples, all inferred-unlocked); off-console branch NOT automatable (SACSwitchToLoginWindow returns EINVAL from background — empirically confirms box is human-only) → finding + human recipe posted to PR #5 (comment 5018069338); reports/fus-via-ssh-gate-verification-260720-*.md. Box stays human-only by OS constraint.
- [ ] 15. deferred: post-merge base sync + worktree teardown — pending, resumes once user confirms the PR is merged
